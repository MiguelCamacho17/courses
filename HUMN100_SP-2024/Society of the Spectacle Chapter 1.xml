         <head>Chapter I. Separation Perfected</head>
         <p>1 In societies where modern conditions of production pre- 
vail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of 
spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has moved away 
into a representation. 2 The images detached from every aspect of life fuse in a 
common stream in which the unity of this life can no longer be 
reestablished. Reality considered partially unfolds, in its own 
general unity, as a pseudo-world apart, an object of mere con- 
templation. The specialization of images of the world is com- 
pleted in the world of the autonomous image, where the liar 
has lied to himself. The spectacle in general, as the concrete 
inversion of life, is the autonomous movement of the non-living. 3 The spectacle presents itself simultaneously as all of soci- 
ety, as part of society, and as instrument of unification. As a 
part of society it is specifically the sector which concentrates 
all gazing and all consciousness. Due to the very fact that this 
sector is separate, it is the common ground of the deceived 
gaze and of false consciousness, andthe unification it achieves 
is nothing but an official language of generalized separation. 4 The spectacle is not a collection of images, but a social 
relation among people, mediated by images. 5 The spectacle cannot be understood as an abuse of the 
world of vision, as a product of the techniques of mass dis- 
semination of images. It is, rather, a Weltanschauung which 
has become actual, materially translated. It is a world vision
which has become objectified. 6 The spectacle, grasped in its totality, is both the result and 
the project of the exsisting mode of production. it is not a sup-  
plement to the real world, an additional decoration. It is the 
heart of the unrealism of the real society. In all its specific 
forms, as information or propaganda, as advertisement or direct 
entertainment consumption, the spectacle is the present model 
of socially dominant life. It is the omnipresent affirmation of
the choice already made in production and its corollary con- 
sumption. The spectacle's form and content are identically 
the total justification of the existing system's conditions and 
goals. The spectacle is also the permanent presence of this 
justification, since it occupies the main part of the time lived
outside of modern production. 7 Separation is itself part of the unity of the world, of the 
global social praxis split up into reality and image. The social 
practice which the autonomous spectacle confronts is also the 
real totality which contains the spectacle. But the split within 
this totality mutilates it to the point of making the spectacle 
appear as its goal. The language of the spectacle consists of 
signs of the ruling production, which at the same time are the 
ultimate goal of this production. 8 One cannot abstractly contrast the spectacle to actual so- 
cial activity: such a division is itself divided. The spectacle 
which inverts the real is in fact produced. Lived reality is ma- 
terially invaded by the contemplation of the spectacle while 
simultaneously absorbing the spectacular order, giving it posi- 
tive cohesiveness. Objective reality is present on both sides. 
Every notion fixed this way has no other basis than its passage 
into the opposite: reality rises up within the spectacle, and the 
spectacle is real. This reciprocal alienation is the essence and 
the support of the existing society. 9. In a world which really is topsy-turvy, the true is a mo- 
ment of the false. 10. The concept of "spectacle" unifies and explains a great 
diversity of apparent phenomena. The diversity and the con- 
trasts are appearances of a socially organized appearance, the 
general truth of which must itself be recognized. Considered in 
its own terms, the spectacle is affirmation of appearance and 
affirmation of all human life, namely social life, as mere ap- 
pearance. But the critique which reaches the truth of the spec- 
tacle exposes it as a visible negation of life, as a negation of
life which has become visible. 11 To To describe the spectacle, its formation, its functions and 
the forces which tend to dissolve it, one must artificially dis- 
tinguish certain inseparable elements. When analyzing the 
spectacle one speaks, to some extent, the language of the spec- 
tacular itself in the sense that one moves through the 
methodological terrain of the very society which expresses it- 
self in the spectacle. But the spectacle is nothing other than the 
sense of the total practice of a social-economic formation, its 
use of time. It is the hisforical movement in which we are 
caught. 12 The spectacle presents itself as something enormously 
positive, indisputable and inaccessible. It says nothing more 
than "that which appears is good, that which is good appears." 
The attitude which it demands in principle is passive accept- 
tance which in fact it already obtained by its manner of appear- 
ing without reply, by its monopoly of appearance. 13 The basically tautological character of the spectacle flows 
from the simple fact that its means are simultaneously its ends. 
It is the sun which never sets over the empire of modern passive- 
ity. It covers the entire surface of the world and bathes end- 
lessly in its own glory. 14 The society which rests on modern industry is not acciden- 
tally or superficially spectacular, it is fundamentally 
spectaclist. In the spectacle, which is the image of the ruling 
economy, the goal is nothing, development everything. The 
spectacle aims at nothing other than itself. 15 As the indispensable decoration of the objects produced 
today, as the general expose of the rationality of the system, as 
the advanced economic sector which directly shapes a growing 
multitude of image-objects, the spectacle is the main 
production of present-day society. 16 The spectacle subjugates living men to itself to the extent 
that the economy has totally subjugated them. It is no more 
than the economy developing for itself. It is the true reflection 
of the production of things, and the false objectification of the 
producers. 18 Where the real world changes into simple images, the sim- 
ple images become real beings and effective motivations of 
hypnotic behavior. The spectacle, as a tendency to make one 
see the world by means of various specialized mediations (it 
can no longer be grasped directly), naturally finds vision to be 
the privileged human sense which the sense of touch was for 
other epochs; the most abstract, the most mystifiable sense cor- 
responds to the generalized abstraction of present-day society. 
But the spectacle is not identifiable with mere gazing, even 
combined with hearing. It is that which escapes the activity of 
men, that which escapes reconsideration and correction by 
their work. It is the opposite of dialogue. Wherever there is 
independent representation, the spectacle reconstitutes itself. 19 The spectacle inherits all the weaknesses of the Western 
philosophica1 project which undertook to comprehend activity 
in terms of the categories of seeing; furthermore, it is based on 
the incessant spread of the precise technical rationality which 
grew out of this thought.The spectacle does not realize 
philosophy, it philosophizes reality. The concrete life of 
everyone has been degraded into a speculative universe. 20 Philosophy, the power of separate thought and the thought 
of separate power, could never by itself supersede theology. 
The spectacle is the material reconstruction of the religious 
illusion. Spectacular technology has not dispelled the religious 
clouds where men have placed their own powers detached from 
themselves; it has only tied them to an earthly base. The most 
earthly life thus becomes opaque and unbreathable. It no longer 
projects into the sky but shelters within itself its absolute de- 
nial, its fallacious paradise. The spectacle is the technical reali- 
zation of the exile of human powers into a beyond; it is separa- 
tion perfected within the interior of man. 21 To the extent that necessity is socially dreamed, the dream 
becomes necessary. The spectacle is the nightmare of impris- 
oned modern society which ultimately expresses nothing more 
than its desire to sleep. The spectacle is the guardian of sleep. 22 The fact that the practical power of modern society de- 
tached itself and built an independent empire in the spectacle 
can be explained only by the fact that this practical power 
continued to lack cohesion and remained in contradiction with 
itself. 23 The oldest social specialization, the specialization of 
power, is at the root of the spectacle. The spectacle is thus a 
specialized activity which speaks for all the others. It is the 
diplomatic representation of hierarchic society to itself, where 
all other expression is banned. Here the most modern is also 
the most archaic. 24 The spectacle is. the existing order's uninterrupted dis- 
course about itself, its laudatory monologue. It is the self- 
portrait of power in the epoch of its totalitarian management of 
the conditions of existence. The fetishistic, purely objective 
appearance of spectacular relations conceals the fact that they 
are relations among men and classes: a second nature with its
fatal laws seem to dominate our environment. But the specta- 
cle is not the necessary product of technical development seen 
as a natural development. The society of the spectacle is on the 
contrary the form which chooses its own technical content. If 
the spectacle, taken in the limited sense of "mass media" 
which are its most glaring superficial manifestation, seems to 
invade society as mere equipment, this equipment is in no way 
neutral but is the very means suited to its total self-movement. 
If the social needs of the epoch in which such techniques are 
developed can only be satisfied through their mediation, if the 
administration of this society and all contact among men can 
no longer take place except through the intermediary of this 
power of instantaneous communication, it is because this 
"communication" is essentially unilateral. The concentration 
of "communication" is thus an accumulation, in the hands of 
the existing system's administration, of the means which allow 
it to carry on this particular administration. The generalized 
cleavage of the spectacle is inseparable from the modern State, 
namely from the general form of cleavage within society, the 
product of the division of social labor and the organ of class 
domination. 25 Separation is the alpha and omega of the spectacle. The 
institutionalization of the social division of labor, the forma- 
ion of classes, had given rise to a first sacred contemplation, 
the mythical order with which every power shrouds itself from 
the beginning. The sacred has justified the cosmic and ontolog- 
ical order which corresponded to the interests of the masters; it 
has explained and embellished that which society could not 
do. Thus all separate power has been spectacular, but the 
adherence of all to an immobile image only signified the com- 
mon acceptance of an imaginary prolongation of the poverty of 
real social activity, still largely felt as a unitary condition. The 
modern spectacle, on the contrary, expresses what society can 
do, but in this expression the permitted is absolutely opposed 
to the possible. The spectacle is the preservation of uncon- 
sciousness within the practical change of the conditions of ex- 
istence. It is its own product, and it has made its own rules: it is 
a pseudo-sacred entity. It shows what it is: separate power de- 
-veloping in itslef, in the growth of productivity by means of the 
incessant refinement of the division of labor into a parcelliza- 
tion of gestures which are then dominated by the independent 
moveme of machines; and working for an ever-expanding 
market. All community and all critical sense are dissolved dur- 
ng this movement in which the forces that could grow by 
separating are not yet reunited. 26 With the generalized separation of the worker and his pro- 
ducts, every unitary view of accomplished activity and all di- 
rect personal communication among producers are lost. Ac- 
companying the progress of accumulation of separate products 
and the concentration of the productive process, unity and 
communication become the exclusive attribute of the system's  
management. The success of thee economic system of separation 
is the proletarianization of the world. 27 Due to the success of separate production as production of 
the separate, the fundamental experience which in primitive 
societies is attached to a central task is in the process of being 
displaced, at the crest of the system's development, by non- 
work, by inactivity. But this inactivity is in no way liberated 
from productive activity: it depends on productive activity and 
is an uneasy and admiring submission to the necessities and 
results of production; it is itself a product of its rationality. 
There can be no freedom outside of activity, and in the context 
of the spectacle all activity is negated, just as real activity has 
been captured in its entirety for the global construction of this 
result. Thus the present "liberation from labor," the increase of 
leisure, is in no way a liberation within labor, nor a liberation 
from the world shaped by this labor. None of the activity lost in 
labor can be regained in the submission to its result. 28 The economic system founded on isolation is a circular 
production of isolation. The technology is based on isolation, 
and the technical process isolates in turn. From the automobile 
to television, all the goods selected by the spectacular system 
are also its weapons for a constant reinforcement of the condi- 
tions of isolation of "lonely crowds." The spectacle constantly 
rediscovers its own assumptions more concretely. 29 The spectacle originates in the loss of the unity of the 
world, and the gigantic expansion of the modern spectacle ex- 
presses the totality of this loss: the abstraction of all specific 
labor and the general abstraction of the entirety of production 
are perfectly rendered in the spectacle, whose mode of being 
concrete is precisely abstraction. In the spectacle, one part of 
the world represents itself to the world and is superior to it. 
The spectacle is nothing more than the common language of 
this separation. What binds the spectators together is no more 
than an irreversible relation at the very center which maintains 
their isolation. The spectacle reunites the separate, but reunites 
it as separate. 30 The alienation of the spectator to the profit of the contem- 
plated object (which is the result of his own unconscious ac- 
tivity) is expressed in the following way: the more he con- 
templates the less he lives; the more he accepts recognizing 
himself in the dominant images of need, the less he under- 
stands his own existence and his own desires. The externality 
of the spectacle in relation to the active man appears in the fact 
that his own gestures are no longer his but those of another 
who represents them to him. This is why the spectator feels at 
home nowhere, because the spectacle is everywhere. 31 The worker does not produce himself; he produces an in- 
dependent power. The success of this production, its abun- 
dance, returns to the producer as an abundance of dis- 
possession. All the time and space of his world become 
foreign to him with the accumulation of his alienated products. 
The spectacle is the map of this new world, a map which ex- 
actly covers its territory. The very powers which escaped us 
show themselves to us in all their force. 32 The spectacle within society corresponds to a concrete 
manufacture of alienation. Economic expansion is mainly the 
expansion of this specific industrial production. What grows 
with the economy in motion for itself can only be the very alien- 
ation which was at its origin. 33 Separated from his product, man himself produces all the 
details of his world with ever increasing power, and thus finds 
himself ever more separated from his world. The more his life 
is now his product, the more he is separated from his life. 34 The spectacle is capital to such a degree of accumulation 
that it becomes an image.</p></div>
