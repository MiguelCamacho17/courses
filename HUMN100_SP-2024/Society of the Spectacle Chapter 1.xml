		 <head>Chapter I. Separation Perfected</head>
		<p>
			1 In societies where modern conditions of production pre- </p><p>vail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of </p><p>spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has moved away </p><p>into a representation.</p><p/><p>2 The images detached from every aspect of life fuse in a </p><p>common stream in which the unity of this life can no longer be </p><p>reestablished. Reality considered partially unfolds, in its own </p><p>general unity, as a pseudo-world apart, an object of mere con- </p><p>templation. The specialization of images of the world is com- </p><p>pleted in the world of the autonomous image, where the liar </p><p>has lied to himself. The spectacle in general, as the concrete </p><p>inversion of life, is the autonomous movement of the non-</p><p>living. </p><p>3 The spectacle presents itself simultaneously as all of soci- </p><p>ety, as part of society, and as instrument of unification. As a </p><p>part of society it is specifically the sector which concentrates </p><p>all gazing and all consciousness. Due to the very fact that this </p><p>sector is separate, it is the common ground of the deceived </p><p>gaze and of false consciousness, andthe unification it achieves </p><p>is nothing but an official language of generalized separation. </p><p>4 The spectacle is not a collection of images, but a social </p><p>relation among people, mediated by images. </p><p>5 The spectacle cannot be understood as an abuse of the </p><p>world of vision, as a product of the techniques of mass dis- </p><p>semination of images. It is, rather, a <term cert="high" evaluate="all" xml:lang="German" xml:space="default">Weltanschauung</term> which </p><p>has become actual, materially translated. It is a world vision
</p><p>which has become objectified. </p><p>6 The spectacle, grasped in its totality, is both the result and </p><p>the project of the exsisting mode of production. It is not a sup- </p><p> 
plement to the real world, an additional decoration. It is the </p><p>heart of the unrealism of the real society. In all its specific </p><p>forms, as information or propaganda, as advertisement or direct </p><p>entertainment consumption, the spectacle is the present model </p><p>of socially dominant life. It is the omnipresent affirmation of
</p><p>the choice already made in production and its corollary con- </p><p>sumption. The spectacle's form and content are identically </p><p>the total justification of the existing system's conditions and </p><p>goals. The spectacle is also the permanent presence of this </p><p>justification, since it occupies the main part of the time lived
</p><p>outside of modern production. </p><p>7 Separation is itself part of the unity of the world, of the </p><p>global social praxis split up into reality and image. The social </p><p>practice which the autonomous spectacle confronts is also the </p><p>real totality which contains the spectacle. But the split within </p><p>this totality mutilates it to the point of making the spectacle </p><p>appear as its goal. The language of the spectacle consists of </p><p>signs of the ruling production, which at the same time are the </p><p>ultimate goal of this production. </p><p>8 One cannot abstractly contrast the spectacle to actual so- </p><p>cial activity: such a division is itself divided. The spectacle </p><p>which inverts the real is in fact produced. Lived reality is ma- </p><p>terially invaded by the contemplation of the spectacle while </p><p>simultaneously absorbing the spectacular order, giving it posi- </p><p>tive cohesiveness. Objective reality is present on both sides. </p><p>Every notion fixed this way has no other basis than its passage </p><p>into the opposite: reality rises up within the spectacle, and the</p><p>spectacle is real. This reciprocal alienation is the essence and </p><p>the support of the existing society. </p><p>9. In a world which really is topsy-turvy, the true is a mo- </p><p>ment of the false. </p><p>10. The concept of "spectacle" unifies and explains a great </p><p>diversity of apparent phenomena. The diversity and the con- </p><p>trasts are appearances of a socially organized appearance, the </p><p>general truth of which must itself be recognized. Considered in </p><p>its own terms, the spectacle is affirmation of appearance and </p><p>affirmation of all human life, namely social life, as mere ap- </p><p>pearance. But the critique which reaches the truth of the spec- </p><p>tacle exposes it as a visible negation of life, as a negation of
</p><p>life which has become visible. </p><p>11 To describe the spectacle, its formation, its functions and </p><p>the forces which tend to dissolve it, one must artificially dis- </p><p>tinguish certain inseparable elements. When analyzing the </p><p>spectacle one speaks, to some extent, the language of the spec- </p><p>tacular itself in the sense that one moves through the </p><p>methodological terrain of the very society which expresses it- </p><p>self in the spectacle. But the spectacle is nothing other than the </p><p>sense of the total practice of a social-economic formation, its </p><p>use of time. It is the hisforical movement in which we are </p><p>caught. </p><p>12 The spectacle presents itself as something enormously </p><p>positive, indisputable and inaccessible. It says nothing more </p><p>than "that which appears is good, that which is good appears." </p><p>The attitude which it demands in principle is passive accept- </p><p>tance which in fact it already obtained by its manner of appear- </p><p>ing without reply, by its monopoly of appearance. </p><p>13 The basically tautological character of the spectacle flows </p><p>from the simple fact that its means are simultaneously its ends. </p><p>It is the sun which never sets over the empire of modern passive- </p><p>ity. It covers the entire surface of the world and bathes end- </p><p>lessly in its own glory. </p><p>14 The society which rests on modern industry is not acciden- </p><p>tally or superficially spectacular, it is fundamentally </p><p>spectaclist. In the spectacle, which is the image of the ruling </p><p>economy, the goal is nothing, development everything. The </p><p>spectacle aims at nothing other than itself. </p><p>15 As the indispensable decoration of the objects produced </p><p>today, as the general expose of the rationality of the system, as </p><p>the advanced economic sector which directly shapes a growing </p><p>multitude of image-objects, the spectacle is the main </p><p>production of present-day society. </p><p>16 The spectacle subjugates living men to itself to the extent </p><p>that the economy has totally subjugated them. It is no more </p><p>than the economy developing for itself. It is the true reflection </p><p>of the production of things, and the false objectification of the </p><p>producers. </p><p>17 The first phase of the domination of the economy over </p><p>social life brought into the definition of all human realization </p><p>the obvious degradation of being into having. The present </p><p>phase of total occupation of social life by the accumulated re- </p><p>sults of the economy leads to a generalized sliding of having </p><p>into appearing, from which all actual "having" must draw its </p><p>immediate prestige and its ultimate function. At the same time </p><p>all individual reality has become social reality directly depen- </p><p>dent on social power and shaped by it. It is allowed to appear </p><p>only to the extent that it is not.</p><p>18 Where the real world changes into simple images, the sim- </p><p>ple images become real beings and effective motivations of </p><p>hypnotic behavior. The spectacle, as a tendency to make one </p><p>see the world by means of various specialized mediations (it </p><p>can no longer be grasped directly), naturally finds vision to be </p><p>the privileged human sense which the sense of touch was for </p><p>other epochs; the most abstract, the most mystifiable sense cor- </p><p>responds to the generalized abstraction of present-day society. </p><p>But the spectacle is not identifiable with mere gazing, even </p><p>combined with hearing. It is that which escapes the activity of </p><p>men, that which escapes reconsideration and correction by </p><p>their work. It is the opposite of dialogue. Wherever there is </p><p>independent representation, the spectacle reconstitutes itself. </p><p>19 The spectacle inherits all the weaknesses of the Western </p><p>philosophical project which undertook to comprehend activity </p><p>in terms of the categories of seeing; furthermore, it is based on </p><p>the incessant spread of the precise technical rationality which </p><p>grew out of this thought. The spectacle does not realize </p><p>philosophy, it philosophizes reality. The concrete life of </p><p>everyone has been degraded into a speculative universe. </p><p>20 Philosophy, the power of separate thought and the thought </p><p>of separate power, could never by itself supersede theology. </p><p>The spectacle is the material reconstruction of the religious </p><p>illusion. Spectacular technology has not dispelled the religious </p><p>clouds where men have placed their own powers detached from </p><p>themselves; it has only tied them to an earthly base. The most </p><p>earthly life thus becomes opaque and unbreathable. It no longer </p><p>projects into the sky but shelters within itself its absolute de- </p><p>nial, its fallacious paradise. The spectacle is the technical reali- </p><p>zation of the exile of human powers into a beyond; it is separa- </p><p>tion perfected within the interior of man. </p><p>21 To the extent that necessity is socially dreamed, the dream </p><p>becomes necessary. The spectacle is the nightmare of impris- </p><p>oned modern society which ultimately expresses nothing more </p><p>than its desire to sleep. The spectacle is the guardian of sleep. </p><p>22 The fact that the practical power of modern society de- </p><p>tached itself and built an independent empire in the spectacle </p><p>can be explained only by the fact that this practical power </p><p>continued to lack cohesion and remained in contradiction with </p><p>itself. </p><p>23 The oldest social specialization, the specialization of </p><p>power, is at the root of the spectacle. The spectacle is thus a </p><p>specialized activity which speaks for all the others. It is the </p><p>diplomatic representation of hierarchic society to itself, where </p><p>all other expression is banned. Here the most modern is also </p><p>the most archaic. </p><p>24 The spectacle is. the existing order's uninterrupted dis- </p><p>course about itself, its laudatory monologue. It is the self- </p><p>portrait of power in the epoch of its totalitarian management of </p><p>the conditions of existence. The fetishistic, purely objective </p><p>appearance of spectacular relations conceals the fact that they </p><p>are relations among men and classes: a second nature with its
</p><p>fatal laws seem to dominate our environment. But the specta- </p><p>cle is not the necessary product of technical development seen </p><p>as a natural development. The society of the spectacle is on the </p><p>contrary the form which chooses its own technical content. If </p><p>the spectacle, taken in the limited sense of "mass media" </p><p>which are its most glaring superficial manifestation, seems to </p><p>invade society as mere equipment, this equipment is in no way </p><p>neutral but is the very means suited to its total self-movement. </p><p>If the social needs of the epoch in which such techniques are </p><p>developed can only be satisfied through their mediation, if the </p><p>administration of this society and all contact among men can </p><p>no longer take place except through the intermediary of this </p><p>power of instantaneous communication, it is because this </p><p>"communication" is essentially unilateral. The concentration </p><p>of "communication" is thus an accumulation, in the hands of </p><p>the existing system's administration, of the means which allow </p><p>it to carry on this particular administration. The generalized </p><p>cleavage of the spectacle is inseparable from the modern State, </p><p>namely from the general form of cleavage within society, the </p><p>product of the division of social labor and the organ of class </p><p>domination. </p><p>25 Separation is the alpha and omega of the spectacle. The </p><p>institutionalization of the social division of labor, the forma- </p><p>tion of classes, had given rise to a first sacred contemplation, </p><p>the mythical order with which every power shrouds itself from </p><p>the beginning. The sacred has justified the cosmic and ontolog- </p><p>ical order which corresponded to the interests of the masters; it </p><p>has explained and embellished that which society could not </p><p>do. Thus all separate power has been spectacular, but the </p><p>adherence of all to an immobile image only signified the com- </p><p>mon acceptance of an imaginary prolongation of the poverty of </p><p>real social activity, still largely felt as a unitary condition. The </p><p>modern spectacle, on the contrary, expresses what society can </p><p>do, but in this expression the permitted is absolutely opposed </p><p>to the possible. The spectacle is the preservation of uncon- </p><p>sciousness within the practical change of the conditions of ex- </p><p>istence. It is its own product, and it has made its own rules: it is </p><p>a pseudo-sacred entity. It shows what it is: separate power de- </p><p>veloping in itslef, in the growth of productivity by means of the </p><p>incessant refinement of the division of labor into a parcelliza- </p><p>tion of gestures which are then dominated by the independent </p><p>movement of machines; and working for an ever-expanding </p><p>market. All community and all critical sense are dissolved dur- </p><p>ing this movement in which the forces that could grow by </p><p>separating are not yet reunited. </p><p>26 With the generalized separation of the worker and his pro- </p><p>ducts, every unitary view of accomplished activity and all di- </p><p>rect personal communication among producers are lost. Ac- </p><p>companying the progress of accumulation of separate products </p><p>and the concentration of the productive process, unity and </p><p>communication become the exclusive attribute of the system's </p><p> 
management. The success of thee economic system of separation </p><p>is the proletarianization of the world. </p><p>27 Due to the success of separate production as production of </p><p>the separate, the fundamental experience which in primitive </p><p>societies is attached to a central task is in the process of being </p><p>displaced, at the crest of the system's development, by non- </p><p>work, by inactivity. But this inactivity is in no way liberated </p><p>from productive activity: it depends on productive activity and </p><p>is an uneasy and admiring submission to the necessities and </p><p>results of production; it is itself a product of its rationality. </p><p>There can be no freedom outside of activity, and in the context </p><p>of the spectacle all activity is negated, just as real activity has </p><p>been captured in its entirety for the global construction of this </p><p>result. Thus the present "liberation from labor," the increase of </p><p>leisure, is in no way a liberation within labor, nor a liberation </p><p>from the world shaped by this labor. None of the activity lost in </p><p>labor can be regained in the submission to its result. </p><p>28 The economic system founded on isolation is a circular </p><p>production of isolation. The technology is based on isolation, </p><p>and the technical process isolates in turn. From the automobile </p><p>to television, all the goods selected by the spectacular system </p><p>are also its weapons for a constant reinforcement of the condi- </p><p>tions of isolation of "lonely crowds." The spectacle constantly </p><p>rediscovers its own assumptions more concretely. </p><p>29 The spectacle originates in the loss of the unity of the </p><p>world, and the gigantic expansion of the modern spectacle ex- </p><p>presses the totality of this loss: the abstraction of all specific</p><p> 
labor and the general abstraction of the entirety of production </p><p>are perfectly rendered in the spectacle, whose mode of being </p><p>concrete is precisely abstraction. In the spectacle, one part of </p><p>the world represents itself to the world and is superior to it. </p><p>The spectacle is nothing more than the common language of </p><p>this separation. What binds the spectators together is no more </p><p>than an irreversible relation at the very center which maintains </p><p>their isolation. The spectacle reunites the separate, but reunites </p><p>it as separate. </p><p>30 The alienation of the spectator to the profit of the contem- </p><p>plated object (which is the result of his own unconscious ac- </p><p>tivity) is expressed in the following way: the more he con- </p><p>templates the less he lives; the more he accepts recognizing </p><p>himself in the dominant images of need, the less he under- </p><p>stands his own existence and his own desires. The externality </p><p>of the spectacle in relation to the active man appears in the fact </p><p>that his own gestures are no longer his but those of another </p><p>who represents them to him. This is why the spectator feels at </p><p>home nowhere, because the spectacle is everywhere. </p><p>31 The worker does not produce himself; he produces an in- </p><p>dependent power. The success of this production, its abun- </p><p>dance, returns to the producer as an abundance of dis- </p><p>possession. All the time and space of his world become </p><p>foreign to him with the accumulation of his alienated products. </p><p>The spectacle is the map of this new world, a map which ex- </p><p>actly covers its territory. The very powers which escaped us </p><p>show themselves to us in all their force. </p><p>32 The spectacle within society corresponds to a concrete </p><p>manufacture of alienation. Economic expansion is mainly the </p><p>expansion of this specific industrial production. What grows </p><p>with the economy in motion for itself can only be the very alien- </p><p>ation which was at its origin. </p><p>33 Separated from his product, man himself produces all the </p><p>details of his world with ever increasing power, and thus finds </p><p>himself ever more separated from his world. The more his life </p><p>is now his product, the more he is separated from his life. </p><p>34 The spectacle is capital to such a degree of accumulation </p><p>that it becomes an image.</p></div>
